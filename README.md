### Project Overview
This repository was created as part of a learning exercise during an Angular crash course. The course can be followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dHNOWTI7H8">here on Traversy Media</a>. The original code for this project is available <a href="https://github.com/bradtraversy/angular-crash-2021/tree/main">here</a> on GitHub.

Please note that the tutorial is somewhat outdated, and I have made some modifications to ensure the system works with the latest version of Angular.

Feel free to explore the code, experiment, and use this as a reference for your own projects!
